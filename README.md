Mobile app to facilitate protected time for healthcare professionals

The user story for this is quite complex.  In Healthcare, there are near-constatnt demands on your time, you recieve calls ans SMS pushes calling you to different rooms, or areas, with no regard to your daily schedule.  This app is designed to work within the structure by allowing each user to "take a break" for 15 minutes, or however long, and by doing so, remove themselves "from the Grid".

During the protected time, any SMS pushes would be automatically re-routed to designated alternates.  Simultaneously, the individuals eligibility to "take 15" would be sent to the bottom of the "priority list" and they would be unable to use it until everyone else in their "tier" has a chance.  There probably shoul dbe some sort of time-based reset as well, say 12 hours, so that just because someone decided NOT to take their time, everyone else is locked out.
